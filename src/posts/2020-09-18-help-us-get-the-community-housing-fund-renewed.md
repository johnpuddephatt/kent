The Community Housing Fund has had a huge impact in recent years, helping a large number of schemes get up and running.

Renewal of the scheme is essential if weâ€™re to keep building on that success. The National Community Land Trust Network are calling for its renewal in the upcoming Comprehensive Spending Review, where the Treasury will set government priorities for spending in the coming years.
