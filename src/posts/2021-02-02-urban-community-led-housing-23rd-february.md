Explore how community led housing can intervene in urban development.  The event consists of 2 sessions - the first looks at methods that citizens of urban neighbourhoods can use to challenge how affordable and low carbon housing is brought forward.  The second focuses on garden villages and towns and CLH involvement.  See [here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/urban-community-led-housing-in-kent-tickets-137806164949) for more info and booking.
