This is an opportunity for Kent's community led housing groups to get together, hear each others' plans and progress.  Some groups will be further down the line than others so it's a good place to make connections so you can share knowledge and information freely.  Also suitable for people thinking of setting up groups and individuals wanting to get involved.  See Eventbrite booking [here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/clh-groups-networking-event-tickets-137437991733?keep_tld=1) for more details
