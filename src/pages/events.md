This session will look at two types of community-led housing for rural areas; Community Land Trusts and Cohousing schemes.

## About this Event

Setting up a Community Land Trust (CLT) can start with a Parish Council or any group of people in a village, in order to provide affordable housing for local people who need it, very often starting with a housing needs survey. The CLT can then work in partnership with a Housing Association to bring a development forward. The CLT has long term stewardship of the homes which remain affordable in perpetuity. There are many advantages to partnering with a housing association which the session will discuss. Tessa Oâ€™Sullivan from the Kent Community Housing Hub and Rural Housing Enabling service and Alison Thompson from English Rural Housing Association will present this subject.

Cohousing schemes create mutually supportive living environments that combine self-contained homes with other shared spaces, buildings and facilities. The type of housing provided will be whatever the future residents require, so they could for instance, be perfect housing developments for older people who want to downsize but stay in their village. We are aware that mainstream developers are not providing the type of housing older people want to buy, for instance 2 or 3 bedroom bungalows; creating a cohousing scheme can overcome this. Cohousing can also be inter-generational, providing homes to buy and also some affordable housing. We will look at examples of other cohousing schemes for older people in the UK. Angela Vincent from UK Cohousing will present this subject.
